"Malik, Abdul; Ali, Muhammad Ichsan; et al.",Promoting sustainable mangrove tourism through payments for ecosystem services: Insights from Tongke-Tongke Village,-5.153087,120.2748,2025,"Tongke-Tongke Village, Sinjai District, South Sulawesi Province","Mangrove ecosystems support biodiversity, protect coastal areas, and provide sustainable livelihoods. However, they face significant threats from deforestation and unsustainable land use practices. This study examines the viability of the payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs in promoting sustainable mangrove tourism in Tongke-Tongke Village, Sinjai District, South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. We collected data through household surveys, semi-structured stakeholder interviews, and tourist questionnaires to evaluate the economic value of mangrove tourism and tourists' willingness to pay (WTP) for conservation. Analytical methods included quantitative descriptive analysis, thematic analysis, travel cost analysis, and contingent valuation method. The results indicated strong community support, with 70.00% of respondents acknowledging sustainable mangrove tourism's economic, environmental, and cultural benefits. Economic estimates revealed that mangrove tourism generated 943.00 USD/(hm2 center dot a), while tourists' WTP for conservation ranged from 0.21 to 0.56 USD/(person center dot month), contributing approximately 11.39 USD/(hm2 center dot a). Despite challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, socioeconomic disparities, and land privatization, this study advocates for integrating the PES programs, enhancing governance frameworks, and fostering local community engagement to ensure equitable benefit distribution and maximize the potential of mangrove tourism. These strategies aim to bolster conservation efforts, improve local livelihoods, and strengthen the resilience of mangrove ecosystems.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666660X25000210?via%3Dihub
"Agustriani, Fitri; Iskandar, Iskhaq; et al.","Economic Valuation of Mangrove Ecosystem Services in Sembilang National Park of South Sumatra, Indonesia",-1.95,104.567,2023,"Sembilang National Park, Banyuasin District, South Sumatra","An ecosystem services valuation could provide significant improvements for the policy maker to monitor the mangrove ecosystem changes in coastal ecosystems. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the value of ecosystem service in Sembilang National Park (NSP), Banyuasin District, South Sumatra, Indonesia. Data collection used questionnaires and in-depth interviews with the target respondents being fishermen, farmers, and stakeholders who live in the mangrove ecosystem area. The total economic value (TEV) was used as an approach for calculating the various values of the mangrove services. Several methods have been developed to estimate the ecosystem services value. In this study, the market price method, benefits transfer method, replacement method, and travel cost method were applied to estimate the benefit value for provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services. The result showed that the TEV of mangrove ecosystem services with an area of 88,556 ha was IDR 6,961,126,186,194 year-1 (US$ 467,974,555.06 year-1) or IDR 78,607,444 ha-1year-1 (US$ 5,284.5 ha-1year-1). The annual benefit values for provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services were IDR 267,301,712,200, IDR 6,401,520,094,447, IDR 292,120,962,048, and IDR 183,417,500, respectively. The benefit value of regulating services (coastline protection and carbon sequestration) dominated the TEV of mangrove ecosystems in the SNP. To avoid the lost value of these mangrove services, conservation and restoration should receive a high priority in mangrove management and planning in the future. These research results could be used as baseline data for local governments in managing mangrove ecosystems through the establishment of a mangrove working group in South Sumatra Province. Therefore, the novelty of this research resided in the first economic valuation in the SNP using the TEV approach, as illustrated.",https://jonuns.com/index.php/journal/article/view/1275/1269

However, awareness of the ecosystem services produced by these ecosystems is relatively low. The aim of this study was to value the habitat quality of mangroves with respect to mangrove ecosystem services using a supply scheme framework as part of supporting ecosystem services. with the Tangerang Coastal Area of Banten Province, Indonesia serving as case study. The findings revealed that the habitat quality could be divided into three value categories: high, medium, and low. The mangrove ecosystem has the highest value at the US $189,027.25 per ha. Within the Tangerang Coastal District, the highest habitat quality value was in the Mauk Sub District, which has, therefore, been placed in the highest category. High habitat quality means that the mangroves can function and be used properly such as the place for spawning and breeding of biota that inhabit their ecosystem. This shows that good habitat quality will also have high economic value. Maintaining and managing mangroves well over the long term will yield the benefits of the mangrove ecosystem and contribute more to the growth of the regional economy.",https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0308597X21003584

However, in the Mahakam delta mangroves have declined considerably. This study examines the factors affecting households’ willingness to pay (WTP) for mangrove restoration in three villages in the Mahakam delta and determines whether a mangrove restoration project would be viable and should be implemented in the study area or not. The contingent valuation method was applied through a double-bound dichotomous choice format to estimate the WTP for mangrove restoration. The results showed that over 80% of perception of respondents considered the benefits of mangroves were essential that associated with their livelihoods. Local residents tended to be willing to pay more for mangrove restoration when they acknowledged the benefits of mangroves and when they felt that the sustainability of mangrove ecosystems was their responsibility. The benefits transfer method was also used to estimate the costs and benefits of an ongoing mangrove restoration project in the study area. The benefits provided by mangroves, as estimated based on households’ WTP, clearly outweighed the costs for the mangrove restoration project. We conclude that mangrove restoration should be implemented in the study area by increasing local communities’ awareness and responsibility to protect and manage the mangrove a sustainable.",https://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/view/65344

Many government and private sectors programs are rolled out to support its development. The development of the Baros mangrove forest must be in accordance with the rules of conservation so that it will not damage the mangrove ecosystem. Mangrove forest has high economical and ecological value but is very vulnerable if lack of wisdom in maintaining, preserving and managing them. The involvement of government and other stakeholders are essential in determining management policies. Unawareness of society and the government to the importance of mangrove ecosystem can cause development of it becomes uncontrolled, consequently can destroy it. Mangrove forests are an important natural resource in coastal environments, and have three main functions: physical, biological, and economic functions. To quantify the functions of mangrove forests as the basis to determine the policy is required a research instrument called economic valuation. The approach of this study is the literature review from various studies before to perceive the influence of economic valuation in determining the management strategy of Baros mangrove forest in Bantul Regency, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/abs/2018/06/e3sconf_icenis2018_08024/e3sconf_icenis2018_08024.html

The data collection techniques used in research are observation, interviews and documentation. The data analysis technique used in this research is descriptive qualitative, used to analyze and systematically process facts obtained from the field assisted by frequency tables. The limit of this research especially analyzed the effects of the socio-economy. The economic impact cannot be separated from activities involving the community starting from clearing land, searching for seeds, nurseries, planting and maintenance. The amount of work done by group members determines the results or income they will obtain. From the results of the data in the field, apart from the social impact that fosters concern for mangrove preservation and mutual cooperation created from togetherness in groups, it can also be seen that the influence of restoration activities on the economy is the involvement of farmer group members, most of whom are involved in seeding and planting. Work is carried out in groups, especially for planting. If you look at the highest income obtained from restoration activities, it is around IDR 401,000 – IDR 500,000 per activity and this is only obtained by 1 person (head of the farmer group), and the majority earn IDR 201,000 – IDR 300,000 (43.47%).",https://www.randwickresearch.com/index.php/rissj/article/view/819/1003
